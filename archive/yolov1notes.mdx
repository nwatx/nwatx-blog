### Predictions

- **Each cell** has the following predictive information:
	- **Bounding box**: The coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the bounding box.
	- **Class $c_i$**: The class of the object, corresponding to the $i$-th label.
	- **Confidence $p$**: The confidence of the prediction.

$$
\text{pred}_\text{cell} = [\: \underbrace{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{20}}_\text{20 different classes}, p_{c_1}, \underbrace{x, y, w, h}_\text{bounding box 1}, p_{c_2}, \underbrace{x, y, w, h}_\text{bounding box 2}\: ]

### Model

#### Architecture

As described in the original paper ([Figure 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf#page=3)), the YoloV1 model is a convolutional neural network with the following architecture:

- Note that the comments in the code describe the specifities of the layers, which are sequentially constructed.

```py:model.py
architecture_config = [
    # Tuple: (kernel_size, num_filters, stride, padding)
    (7, 64, 2, 3),
    # max pooling
    "M",
    (3, 192, 1, 1),
    # max pooling
    "M",
    (1, 128, 1, 0),
    (3, 256, 1, 1),
    (1, 256, 1, 0),
    (3, 512, 1, 1),
    # max pooling
    "M",
    # List: tuples. Last integer represents number of repeats
    [(1, 256, 1, 0), (3, 512, 1, 1), 4],
    (1, 512, 1, 0),
    (3, 1024, 1, 1),
    # max pooling
    "M",
    [(1, 512, 1, 0), (3, 1024, 1, 1), 2],
    (3, 1024, 1, 1),
    (3, 1024, 2, 1),
    (3, 1024, 1, 1),
    (3, 1024, 1, 1)
