Since Java is the first language that most people learn, it makes sense that there are a lot of tricks that are untold among newer users. In this short blog post, hopefully we can bring some of these tricks to light.

The first trick is adding `import static java.lang.System.out` at the top of your file. This allows you to shorten the print syntax greatly (and is often tested anyways).

## Basic Language Tricks

```java
import static java.lang.System.out;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // functions as the traditionally longer System.out.println();
        out.println("a"); // a
        out.println("b"); // b
    }
}
```

Another very common pattern is reading input into a group of "like-typed" elements, such as a group of integers. Instead of doing the following:

```java
int a, b;
a = in.nextInt();
b = in.nextInt();
```

We can instead do

```java
int a = in.nextInt(), b = in.nextInt();
```

Another very nice to know trick in Java is to use built-in pair class (JavaFx) or use your own if that is not supported. Attached below is mine.

```java
private static class Pair<T, V> {
    T l;
    V r;

    Pair(T l, V r) {
        this.l = l;
        this.r = r;
    }
}
```

When calling this class, it's as simple as

```java
Pair<int, int> a = new Pair(1, 2); // { 1, 2 }
out.println(a.l); // 1
out.println(a.r); // 2
```

## Problem Solving Tricks

This is not really a Java specific problemm solving trick, but rather a more generalized one. Let's start with a simple olympiad problem, [Fence Painting](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=567).

There are two approaches to this problem, either you compute casework for it, which would equate to $(b-a)+(d-c)-\text{intersection}([a,b],[c,d])$. This requires a little thinking (although not very much), or you can be naive, and directly simulate placing the intervals - checking which squares contain at least one square of paint.

Here is the code (assume all imports are done):

### Brute Force

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    boolean[] painted = new boolean[101];
    int a = in.nextInt(), b = in.nextInt(), c = in.nextInt(), d = in.nextInt();
    for(int i = a; i < b; i++) painted[i] = true;
    for(int i = c; i < d; i++) painted[i] = true;
    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 101; i++) if(painted[i]) ans++;
    out.println(ans);
}
```

### Math

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a = in.nextInt(), b = in.nextInt(), c = in.nextInt(), d = in.nextInt();
    out.println(b - a + d - c - max(min(b,d)-max(a,c), 0));
}
```
