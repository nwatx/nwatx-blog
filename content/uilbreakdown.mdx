# Introduction

The UIL computer science exam is a _45-minute written exam for an individual and team component, as well as a two-hour programming contest for teams._ Because the advancement criteria is only the top 3 spots, it is critical for winners to achieve as high a score as possible. Unfortunately, the exam is given in Java, which means most of studying time should be reading through the documentation and intracicies of the Java programming language. Since most of the "easy" problems are easy to do and understand, we will instead discuss most of the advanced tricks and patterns that are encountered on the UIL computer science exam.

## Things you should know before diving into this article

Before reading this article, it's important to gain a general understanding of computer science otherwise the following topics presented may be difficult to understand.

<Pros
  title="Things that you should already know"
  pros={[
    "An AP Computer Science understanding of Java",
    "The basics of bit operations (what they do)",
    "Basic knowledge of what a tree is",
  ]}
/>

If you don't know any of these materials, you can use the following resources to get started:

- [Progamiz - General Java](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming)
- [GeeksForGeeks - Bitwise operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-java/)
- [Wikipedia - Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

Furthermore, you should be somewhat exposed to the following data structures:

<Pros
  title="Data structures you should be familiar with"
  pros={[
    "ArrayList",
    "Array",
    "LinkedList",
    "Trees (in general)",
    "Binary Search Trees",
    "Queue",
    "PriorityQueue",
    "Stack",
  ]}
/>

and the following algorithms:

<Pros
  title="Algorithms you should be familiar with"
  pros={[
    "Sorting (general)",
    "Binary Search",
    "Brute force (general)",
    "Complete search (general)",
  ]}
/>

as well as the concept of [inheritance](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/inheritance).

# Primitive Operations

<Problem choices={['3.0', '3', '4', '4.0']} answer='3.0' explanation="Since all of the operators are of equal precedence, simply evaluate this expression from left to right.">

What is the output of `out.println(12/4.0*5/5)`

</Problem>

- The four basic operations `+,-,/,*` and `%` can be performed from any of type `int, char, double, long, etc...` to each other without erroring.

- When performing operations on characters, perform a conversion of `char->int` before applying any operations. Recall that the ASCII values for `0, A, a` are $48$, $65$, and $97$ respectively.
