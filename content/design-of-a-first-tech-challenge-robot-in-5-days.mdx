As a high schooler competing in FIRST, I love to build robots. However, robots
require money. During the offseason, it is both costly and grants little
competitive advantage to build entire robots. Typically, doing 3d CAD modeling
and preparing autonomous routines for the upcoming season is how we spend our
time.

As a result, I decided to ask two of my friends to compete in the Valor CAD
Challenge to determine who could design the best robot in one week. Up to three
people form a team, competing in a hypothetical FIRST game. This year, it was
[SuperShot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxZ_uT60IzYI4vUXYl7QVfYJL4FF1KRHi-K8Gg2Pgl8/edit),
a frisbee shooting game.

# Design Process

At the game release, our team's brainstorming strategy was to **generate ideas
for all subsystems and divide each subsystem into a person.** This brainstorming
technique proved to be effective: almost all of the designs were unique in one
way or another, and it was somewhat easy to distinguish which ones would be
viable or not.

For us, this made sense from our actual team experience, **too many people
working on a single subsystem often leads to repeated steps, meaning wasted
time.**

## Drive Subassembly

Our philosophy was to keep the drive base simple. Since in other FTC games,
using a mecanum (aka Swedish Wheel) chassis would provide finer control,
stability, and maneuverability without sacrificing the speed of a tank drive
(otherwise known as a six-wheel-drive), we decided to design one for this game.
Our time was limited (5 days), so we wanted to finish this assembly as quickly
as possible and mount the other sub-assemblies on top.

Naturally, we gravitated towards using aluminum box tube extrusion. It is
lightweight, durable, and relatively easy to work with 3D CAD software (for this
competition, we used a combination of SolidWorks and Fusion 360). We assembled
the frame in an H-Shape, as shown below:

Another core design feature of our drive was the three odometer wheels located
as shown below:

/>

These wheels allow the robot to triangulate its position by measuring the delta
in encoder ticks for each wheel and accumulating them over time. You can find a
more detailed paper on this system

## Frisbee Shooter Subassembly

We brainstormed the following ideas for our frisbee shooting subassembly:

- Vertically-oriented shooter
- Horizontal-oriented shooter
- Diagonal-oriented shooter
- Linear extension

<NextImage
	src="v1631751878/blog/robotics/RENDER_THIS_NEO_YEA_YEA_2019-Jul-19_03-38-34PM-000_CustomizedView26552434606_png_alpha_gltaup.png"
	width={1920}
	height={1080}
/>

As we took a closer look at the proposed linear extension implementation, we
determined that the extension would be far too slow as our robot would have to
travel the field's distance to score. It was at this point that we decided the
robot needed a frisbee shooter. Since our proposed frisbee-intake takes in the
frisbees horizontally, it would make sense that we would choose a
horizontally-oriented shooter, as the transfer mechanism from the frisbee-intake
to the shooter would be more straightforward.

Also, since separating the shooter's rotary (actual rotation of the turret vs.
the flywheel) motors would be relatively easy, and we had a bit of spare time,
we decided to power share the motors using a differential.

## Frisbee Intake Subassembly

The shape of the frisbee proved to both be a challenge and an ally. The 6"
diameter disks used for the CADathon The challenging part was that the disk was
relatively hard to pick off the ground, as there was a hollow cavity separating
the middle portions of the disk and the floor. However, the circular shape meant
it would be aligned no matter which angle the intake grabbed it.

Since the disk was low to the ground, it was clear that a low-but-wide vacuum
cleaner type sucker would be the best fit for the task.

Our design consisted of a belt-driven intake because it allowed us to contain
the motor within the intake area. Also, directly driven motors tend to break
much more quickly because the load is placed on the shaft. Our motor belt
transferred power to the conveyer belt system, which would then transmit power
through the outer blue roller of the intake (we ran a hex axle through the
conveyer belt, which was connected by another pulley to the blue roller).

## Climb Subassembly

We noticed that the area that we needed to climb was located relatively high off
the ground (23"), and because of the 18" x 18" x 18" size restriction placed on
our robot, a compact but robust extension system would be ideal. As a result, we
implemented a straight winch-driven linkage to climb. The subsystem would extend
upwards quickly (< 1 seconds in simulations), and the robot would be off the
ground in ~1.5 seconds. A topology study was used to optimize the selective
pocketing to lighten the climb.

## Integrating Subassemblies

Since our team distributed the workload of all the subassemblies among my other
two teammates, we would need to figure out a way to combine these subassemblies
without fighting for space. To accomplish this goal, we created an approximate
3d layout sketch of the robot. Each subsystem would be placed in its associated
region to solve the conflicts.

There are several challenges we encountered while integrating the systems.

- Mounting all the pieces onto the robot — we solved this by using organic
  brackets that would generate no matter where we moved the parts.
- Electronics mounting — we needed a way to position the electronics to
  interfere with our critical subassemblies. To solve this, we used the unused
  space on the robot's side to package a Logitech C270 camera and our two
  control hubs.
- Mounting the climb subassembly — in our layout sketch, we anticipated the
  climb to be positioned in the robot's back. However, the climb took up more
  space than expected, so it had to be moved to either side or the front. We
  ended up choosing the side since if it were to be mounted on the front, not
  only would the camera have to move, but the body of the intake and the climb
  would intersect.

# Judging

This stage of the competition both delivers the results and feedback that we
could use to improve our skills next time (as well as for the upcoming season).
Since this was our first CADathon, we were naturally nervous and didn't know
what to expect. We included several renders and key notebook slides explaining
how our robot would function to distinguish ourselves from our competitors.

## Results

### Feedback Delivered on Our Robot

- Unable to get over the barrier. Our tri-wheel positional localizer ended up
  hurting us since the judges believed it was impossible to get over the
  barrier. Although one of our other teammates had already implemented this
  system in real life, having no trouble getting over physical boundaries, we
  were still marked off.

- Intake could not transfer. Since we mounted our intake mechanism at a
  90-degree angle, we overlooked that it would not be able to deposit the
  frisbees into our shooter. Although the rubrics were not released, we believed
  this to be the main downfall of our placement.

Despite these remarks on our robot, we still placed 7th out of 53 teams overall,
even beating out the larger
[F4 Cadathon's](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/7th-bi-annual-f4-cadathon/360628/18)
1st place prize-winning team.

# Changes in Philosophy

1. Design process: Design the parts first and then decide on mounting later =>
   choose available mounting positions first, design the mounts, and then fit
   the part to the mount.

2. Use of sheet metal: The use of sheet metal also surprised us. The
   second-place team's use of sheet metal made almost perfect use of the space
   constraints. Their design looked complex when studying their robot more
   closely because of their clever arrangement of sheet metal. Team 10
   (second-place team)

3. Workspace collaboration: Ideally we would transition from Fusion 360 Cloud
   Integrated => GrabCAD Workbench. Since two of us used SolidWorks while the
   other used Fusion 360, it was relatively hard to collaborate. Transferring
   files was a pain; we would commonly have to export our SolidWorks files as a
   .STEP file, which would be uneditable in the Fusion 360 viewer. In
   retrospect, it would be wiser for our Fusion 360 user to switch to
   SolidWorks; after all, CAD programs are relatively similar.

4. Rendering Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Visualize => Fusion 360 or Keyshot.
   From our experience, the time it would take to tune the Visualize materials
   to more resemble reality was too much work compared to using the presets that
   both Fusion 360 and Keyshot provided.

# Final Thoughts

Regarding the competition as a whole, I felt that it was a massive boost to both
my 3d modeling and collaborative skills. After several days of competing, I
found that I could design and model things much faster than during the beginning
of the competition. For example, the first iteration of the intake took me 1.5
days to finish, but then I managed to complete both the second and the final
iteration of the intake mechanism in a single day.

This year in the 2019–2020 SkyStone (the actual game), I have found that I have
put the skills I've attained from the CADathon to use. I designed, modeled, and
rendered every component shown on the robot below, moving far more quickly than
the previous year, and indeed the practice of 3D modeling for hours on end
helped.
