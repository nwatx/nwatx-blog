## Introduction and Rules

We discovered this game at the Harvard Undergraduate Traders Competition. It's a
fun and interesting poker variant that we've never seen before. We don't know
what the game is called, but "5-8 Poker" or "Street Poker" is what we have
been calling it. Here's how it works:

- The player makes a "rule" that allows them to choose any subset of cards from
  the deck. For example, any spade, 9 or higher, etc.
- The dealer then deals out cards until the a card matching the rule is drawn.
  This card is then given to the player, and any remaining cards are given to
  the dealer.
- This process repeats until the player reaches 5 cards or the deck is empty.
- The player then makes the best poker hand they can with the 5 cards they have.
- If the dealer has less than 8 cards, they draw until they reach eight cards,
  and then the dealer makes the same best 5 hand with their cards.
- The winner is the player with the best hand, if they are the same, the dealer
  wins.

**Example Game**

- Player makes a rule: "Any 9 or higher"
- Dealer deals out cards: 7♠, 8♠, 9♠, so the player gets the 9♠ and the dealer
  gets the 7♠ and 8♠.
- Player makes a rule: "Any broadway card or spades 8 or higher"
- Dealer deals: 6♥️, 2♥️, 10♠, so the player gets the 10♠.
- At this point the player has the 9♠ and 10♠, and the dealer has the 7♠, 8♠,
  6♥️, 2♥️.
- Player makes a rule: "Any spade"
- Dealer deals: 4♥️ 3♠, the player gets the 3♠.
- The player has three cards at this point, and the dealer has 7♠, 8♠, 6♥️, 2♥️,
  4♥️.
- Let's say the player makes two more rules and gets dealt two more cards to
  form the flush A♠, K♠, Q♠, 10♠, 9♠.
- Now, since the dealer has 5, they draw until they have 8 cards.
- The dealer draws 7♦️, 7♣️, 6♠ to form the last three (an extremely unfortunate
  scenario), and they boat up with 7♠, 7♦️, 7♣️, 6♠, 6♥️. The dealer wins
  because they have a full house (which beats a flush).

## Basic Strategy Discovered

We still don't know the optimal strategy for this game, but we have a basic
strategy. The gist is that you want to maximize the number of cards you get
while minimizing the number of cards the dealer gets. This is because the dealer
has a higher chance of getting a better hand with more cards.

Therefore, the player tends try to keep the dealer under and as close to 8 cards
as possible. The first move tends to be a rule like "any 9 or higher", because
we can calculate the expected number of cards to come to be $6\cdot 4 = 24$, and
we expected the dealer to draw $\frac{52 - 24}{24} \approx 1.17$ cards. The
player then is able to tighten the rule in order to keep the dealer under 8
cards. We also know that under this strategy, pairs will be "stronger," which
helps odds.

Some other things that can be done are:

- The player can draw a card that is in the dealer's hand to prevent them from
  getting a better hand.
- The player can draw straight/flush blockers in order to prevent the dealer
  from getting a straight/flush.
- If all fails and the player still has a possibility of getting a royal flush,
  draw until they get it, as equity is still not the worst.

## Concluding Thoughts

This game is a fun and interesting variant of poker that we've never seen
before. It requires a different strategy than traditional poker, and we're still
working on figuring out the optimal strategy. If someone does have the expected
value of the game, please contact me since my friends and I are both interested.

We suggest the following methods would be good to compute an approximation:

- Reinforcement Learning
- Dynamic Programming
