## Description

As part of a fun robotics project, I have created a program that will detect
tennis balls in a live camera feed. Of course, the end goal is to create a fully
autonomous tennis collection system, but detection plays a critical part in the
deeper control system I'm aiming to develop.

The program is written in Python and uses OpenCV to detect tennis balls. Here is
the detection pipeline:

1. Resize the image to 640 x 480 pixels.
2. Run the image through a custom trained version of the YOLO neural network.
   Below is a diagram of the model architecture

   For the curious, here is the YoloV5 loss function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\lambda_{coord} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj}[(x_i-\hat{x}_i)^2 + (y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2 ] \\&+ \lambda_{coord} \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj}[(\sqrt{w_i}-\sqrt{\hat{w}_i})^2 +(\sqrt{h_i}-\sqrt{\hat{h}_i})^2 ]\\
&+ \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj}(C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2 + \lambda_{noobj}\sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^B \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{noobj}(C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2 \\
&+ \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \mathbb{1}_{i}^{obj}\sum_{c \in classes}(p_i(c) - \hat{p}_i(c))^2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Cache past detection areas of interest, and feed the points to the robot to
   pathfind to the next points of interest.

4. Run the image through a traveling salesman optimization algorithm to find the
   best path to traverse the image.

5. Draw the path on the image.
