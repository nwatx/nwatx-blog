<!-- TODO: MAKE THIS BLOG ACTUALLY CORRECT -->

# Introduction

This morning, I had just taken a Linear Algebra test, which in the post-mortem
discussion of the test, realized that Singular Value Decomposition had most
likely been the most missed topic. In fact, people even chose to skip questions
that simply contained the wrongly-accursed words of "Singular Value
Decomposition." The previous evening, I experienced a similar feeling, though it
was through several Youtube videos and quite a bit of lecture notes that I was
able to realize the simple algorithm for computing singular value decomposition.
Interestingly enough, not many of them covered the method that I'm about to
write about.

As usual (or not really "as usual", since this is the first explanatory blog
post), explanations often make the most sense with an example, so I will provide
one! Note that this is the same example as
[this MIT OCW Example](https://youtu.be/cOUTpqlX-Xs), just in case you want to
cross reference.

Since this is mainly about the solving process,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) provides
a fairly detailed explanation on what the matrix is being decomposed to.

# Example

Find the Singular Value Decomposition of $A$.

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}5&5\\-1&7\end{bmatrix}
$$

The key to finding the SVD is through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $AA^T$
and $A^TA$. In fact, these two matrices correspond to $U$ and $V$ respectively,
although they must be normalized first. What's even nicer is that you only have
to solve for the eigenvalues once; the _nonzero_ eigenvalues of $AA^T$ are the
same as $A^TA$. Since $A^TA$ is guranteed to be a
[definite symmetric matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_symmetric_matrix),
I usually chose to solve for this one first.

$$
A^TA = \begin{bmatrix}26&18\\18&74\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can then solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively using
standard methods. In this example, the $\lambda_1 = 80$ and $\lambda_2=20$. The
eigenvectors then are $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}$ and
$\begin{bmatrix}-3\\1 \end{bmatrix}$ respectively. If we normalize these two
vectors, then we get

$$
V = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}&\frac{-3}{\sqrt{10}}\\ \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}\end{bmatrix}
$$

Next, we calculate $AA^T$

$$
AA^T = \begin{bmatrix}50&30\\30&50\end{bmatrix}
$$

Recall that since the nonzero eigenvalues are the same for both $A^TA$ and
$AA^T$, we can skip the calculation of those and directly find the eigenvectors
of $AA^T$.

The eigenvector matrix of $AA^T$ then, is

$$
AA^T=
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 1 \\
-1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Which gets normalized to

$$
U=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

That's it! All that's left are the $\sigma$'s, which we happen to have already
solved for, since $\sigma_i=\sqrt{\lambda_i}$. Since all our eigenvalues are
positive (and will always be positive), it's very easy to take the square root
of $\lambda_i$

Remember that it's important to "line-up" the values of $\sigma_i$ with the
appropriate eigenvectors such that the $i$-th column of $V$ and $U$ correspond
to $\sigma_i$. In my calculations, this has already been kept track of, so we
find

$$
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{80} & 0 \\
0 & \sqrt{20}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
4\sqrt{5} & 0 \\
0 & 2\sqrt{5}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

All that's left now is to plug them into our initial equation, where we get

$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
4\sqrt{5} & 0 \\
0 & 2\sqrt{5}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}&\frac{-3}{\sqrt{10}}
\\ \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can verify our answer as correct using
