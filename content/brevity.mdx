I like brief. It's concise, clear. It's akin to poetry, but even masterful
poetry is sometimes difficult to understand.

As I write, I always wonder if I'm redundant—a different word here, an extra
word there. I'm conflicted; I'm wondering if a slight clarification is worth the
additional phrase, and even then, it varies across readers. I'd like to avoid
"spoon-feeding," because engagement is critical. On the other hand, the price of
clarity cannot be too high.

Brevity poses an interesting design decision, challenging to make when arbitrary
limits—like word count or word length—are imposed. I'd love to hear any
thoughts.
